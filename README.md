An android app for recognizing landmarks.

# The Model
The machine learning model uses tensorflow's keras Sequential model to classify landmarks.
The number of layers used are 4 and one hidden layer.
The 1st and 2nd layer use 64 neurons & 3rd and 4th both use 128 neurons.
The hidden layer uses 512 neurons.
All the four layers use "relu" activation and the hidden layer uses "softmax".
